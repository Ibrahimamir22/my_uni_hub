# Community Slug Page Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to the community slug page.

## 1. Component Structure Improvements

- **Split into smaller components**
  - Extracted tab components (AboutTab, MembersTab, PostsTab) into separate files
  - Used React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
  - Implemented a more maintainable file structure

## 2. Data Fetching Optimizations

- **Implemented SWR pattern**
  - Added useCommunityWithSWR and useCommunityPostsWithSWR hooks
  - Automatic revalidation and caching of data
  - Better error handling and retry logic
  - Optimistic UI updates for better UX

## 3. Rendering Optimizations

- **Lazy loading with code splitting**
  - Used React.lazy and Suspense to defer loading of tab components
  - Implemented TabSkeleton for better loading UX

- **List virtualization**
  - Added VirtualizedList component for efficiently rendering large lists
  - Only renders items currently in the viewport
  - Uses PostListVirtualized component to apply virtualization to posts
  - Toggle between standard and optimized view

## 4. Performance Monitoring

- **Added performance metrics**
  - PerformanceMonitor component to track render times
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP) tracking
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) tracking

## 5. Responsive Improvements

- **Window size tracking**
  - Added useWindowSize hook for responsive adjustments
  - Better handling of window resize events

## 6. Navigation Optimizations

- **Implemented navigation prefetching**
  - Added NavigationPrefetcher component for smarter prefetching
  - Prioritizes likely navigation paths based on current tab
  - Implements tiered prefetching (high, medium, low priority)
  - Reduces perceived navigation latency

## Performance Impact

- Reduced initial page load time
- Decreased time to interactive
- More efficient memory usage with virtualization
- Better caching for frequently accessed data
- Smoother tab transitions with code splitting
- Improved perceived performance with prefetching

## Further Optimization Opportunities

1. Implement intersection observer for better lazy loading of media
2. Add query param synchronization for active tab
3. Implement view transition API for smoother tab transitions
4. Add more sophisticated prefetching for predicted user behavior
5. Implement service worker for offline capability
6. Add resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch) for API endpoints
